# ðŸš¨ Deprecated: Ï€-crust Macros

This repository has been deprecated.

Piecrust Macros is no longer maintained, as all functionality has been consolidated and improved in [Dusk Forge](https://github.com/HDauven/dusk-forge).

`piecrust-macros` is a macro library designed to simplify the development of smart contracts for Dusk's [Piecrust virtual machine](https://github.com/dusk-network/piecrust). It provides macros to automatically generate the boilerplate code required for interfacing smart contracts with the Piecrust VM.

## Usage

The main feature of `piecrust-macros` is the `#[contract]` attribute macro. This macro automatically generates wrapper functions required for interfacing with the Piecrust VM, reducing boilerplate code in your project.

Add `piecrust_macros` as a dependency to your contract project:
```sh
cargo add piecrust_macros
```

To use the macro, import it into your Rust smart contract and annotate your contract's implementation with #[contract]:

```rust
#![no_std]

use piecrust_macros::contract;

/// Struct that describes the state of the Counter contract
pub struct Counter {
    value: i64,
}

/// State of the Counter contract
static mut STATE: Counter = Counter { value: 0xfc };

#[contract]
impl Counter {
    /// Read the value of the counter
    pub fn read_value(&self) -> i64 {
        self.value
    }

    /// Increment the value of the counter by 1
    pub fn increment(&mut self) {
        let value = self.value + 1;
        self.value = value;
    }
}
```

With #[contract], the macro automatically generates the necessary wrapper functions for each public method in the impl block you want to expose.
